Interpreter :-
      The Python interpreter is a bytecode interpreter: its input is instruction sets called bytecode. When you write Python, the leser, parser, and compiler generate code objects for the interpreter to operate on. Each code object contains a set of instructions to be executed—that's the bytecode—plus other information that the interpreter will need. Bytecode is an intermediate representation of Python code: it expresses the source code that you wrote in a way the interpreter can understand. It's analogous to the way that assembly language serves as an intermediate representation between C code and a piece of hardware.

Python shell  : -
  	       Python is an interpreter language. It means it executes the code line by line. Python provides a Python Shell, which is used to execute a single Python command and display the result.It is also known as REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop), where it reads the command, evaluates the command, prints the result, and loop it back to read the command again.

Indentation :- 
	 Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
Atoms :-

Keywords :- 
	Keywords are the reserved words in Python. We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name or any other identifier. They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.
Identifiers :-
	An identifier is a name given to entities like class, functions, variables, etc. It helps to differentiate one entity from another.

Literals :-	
	Literals in Python is defined as the raw data assigned to variables or constants while programming. We mainly have five types of literals which includes string literals, numeric literals, Boolean  literals, literal collections and a special literal None.
Strings :- 	
	A string is a sequence of characters .A character is simply a symbol. For example, the English language has 26 characters .In Python, a string is a sequence of Unicode characters. Unicode was introduced to include every character in all languages and bring uniformity in encoding.
EG :-   	 my_string = 'Hello'
print(my_string)

Operators :-         
	Python Operators in general are used to perform operations on values and variables. These are standard symbols used for the purpose of logical and arithmetic operations. In this article, we will look into different types of Python operators.
