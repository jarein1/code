The Python interpreter is a bytecode interpreter: its input is instruction sets called bytecode. When you write Python, the lexer, parser, and compiler generate code objects for the interpreter to operate on. Each code object contains a set of instructions to be executed—that's the bytecode—plus other information that the interpreter will need. Bytecode is an intermediate representation of Python code: it expresses the source code that you wrote in a way the interpreter can understand. It's analogous to the way that assembly language serves as an intermediate representation between C code and a piece of hardware.

Python is an interpreter language. It means it executes the code line by line. Python provides a Python Shell, which is used to execute a single Python command and display the result.It is also known as REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop), where it reads the command, evaluates the command, prints the result, and loop it back to read the command again.

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
